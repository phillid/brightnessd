# brightnessd

Simple tool for smoothly adjusting backlight brightness

The initial version was cobbled together as a five-minute-fix in early 2015.
I left the code untouched (don't mess with a house of cards) until over a year
later when I am now going through and refactoring it.


At least it doesn't use pthreads anymore.
